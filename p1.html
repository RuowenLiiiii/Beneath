            <h2>THE WELL-TRODDEN ART OF THE MANHOLE COVER IN NEW YORK CITY
            </h2>
            <h3>Allison Meier

            <p id="textContent">
                If you take a moment to look down while walking through New York City’s bustling streets, you’ll be greeted by an intriguing mix of markings and symbols. From manhole covers to spray-painted utility codes and crosswalk stripes, the ground itself is a cacophony of signs that tell stories about the city’s infrastructure. To get a closer look at this hidden layer of urban history, we ventured to Greenwich Village with Justin Rivers, an expert in New York’s overlooked architectural treasures. Specifically, we explored the area around Minetta Street, a paradise for manhole cover enthusiasts.
                Within just two short blocks, you’ll encounter a diverse array of manhole covers—each corresponding to different utilities such as gas, water, sewer, and the subway. Among these, a DPW (Department of Public Works) cover on Minetta Street stands out as a particularly fascinating relic. If you peer through one of the open holes on the cover with a flashlight, you’ll catch a glimpse of the Minetta Brook, a hidden remnant of New York’s natural landscape. This freshwater brook once served early New Yorkers but has since been buried beneath layers of concrete, now flowing through the city’s vast sewer system.
                The DPW cover offers a direct link to the past, as it predates the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, the modern agency responsible for the city’s water and sewage systems. It’s just one example of the many abbreviations you’ll find etched into New York’s manhole covers, each representing a different aspect of the city’s sprawling infrastructure. These small details provide a glimpse into how the city’s underground systems evolved over time, giving life to what might otherwise be viewed as mundane street fixtures. As you explore these covers, you’re not just walking over metal discs; you’re treading on layers of history, each one a testament to New York’s ongoing journey from its natural roots to the complex, modern metropolis it is today. NYC Sewer manhole cover from a late-Victorian DPW manhole cover with ornate lettering, to a more industrial DPW manhole cover, to the classic NYC Sewer manhole cover, to one that is also “MADE IN INDIA,” as well as one that simply says “SEWER.”
                Each manhole cover is a portal to an underground world below. In popular culture, what lies beneath has been explored repeatedly, perhaps most notably by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who would pop a manhole cover to go down to their underground lair that they shared with Splinter, the mutant rat who raised them. The NYC Sewer manhole cover also doubled as a weapon.
                Popular fascination with underground systems continues to be manifested in the websites of urban explorers, writers and photographers. This enthrallment can be attributed in part to the rich mythological origins of a fabled underground. In Greek and Roman mythology, Hades is an underground world of arrivals, transition, and temporality. Even if we don’t think of the world under New York City’s streets as a place for lost souls, manholes still remain as a portal between the city as us mortals experience it and the underbelly that supports our existence.
                The earliest manhole covers you can find in cities are usually coal hole covers. Made of cast iron, they are generally square or rectangular in shape, sometimes hexagonal. They led to former coal chutes in residences and commercial buildings. Although coal is no longer used to heat homes, you can still find coal hole covers in some of New York City’s oldest districts, like Brooklyn Heights.
                But the round manhole covers that most people think of are usually connected to essential services like water, sewers, and power. The advent of modern urban existence in the 1800s necessitated the removal of these services underground. It was part functional but also a utopian ideal, intended to preserve the beauty of cities.
                The word “sewer” is defined in old English as “seaward,” which described the open drainage ditches that sloped downwards to the Thames River. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the origin of the word sewer to the old French word seuwiere, meaning “a channel to drain overflow.” By the nineteenth century, the waste from these conduits in all the major cities eventually overwhelmed the ability of natural bodies of water, like rivers and ponds, to self-cleanse. London experienced what is known as “The Great Stink” of 1858. The particular potency of the pollution that summer shut down government and prompted lawmakers to finally enforce and enact public health legislation.
                Baron Georges Haussmann, who is credited with laying out modern Paris wrote in 1854, “The underground galleries, organs of the large city, would function like those of the human body, without revealing themselves to the light of day. Pure and fresh water, light, and heat would circulate there like the diverse fluids whose movement and maintenance support life. Secretions would take place there mysteriously and would maintain public health without troubling the good order of the city and without spoiling its exterior beauty.”
                New York City was going through something similar. Like all early settlements, New Yorkers initially relied on existing bodies of water for fresh drinking water. Collect Pond is the most famous, located near the courthouses in Lower Manhattan today. The nearly 50-acre lake was the main source of drinking water, fed by an underground spring. But polluting industries like slaughterhouses, breweries, and tanneries built along the pond’s shores contaminated the water and eventually, the pond was filled in.
                The transformation of the landscape around Collect Pond, once a natural freshwater resource, marked a significant chapter in New York City’s relentless expansion. The pond, which had become heavily polluted due to industrial runoff and poor sewage management, was eventually filled in, giving way to one of the city’s most infamous neighborhoods: Five Points. This area, immortalized in Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York, became a symbol of the city’s rough-and-tumble urban life in the 19th century. The pollution was so severe that authorities constructed a canal to drain the pond, but this canal soon became an open sewer itself, adding to the filth and contamination of the area. When the canal was finally filled in, it left behind what we now know as Canal Street—its name a lasting reminder of its original function.
                The health implications of this unregulated development were disastrous. One of the worst outcomes of the contaminated water supply was the cholera epidemic. The first wave of cholera in 1832 killed 3,500 New Yorkers, a staggering number that, adjusted for population, would be the equivalent of 100,000 deaths in today’s city—a sobering comparison to the toll of COVID-19. Over the next few decades, New York City would be hit by four more waves of cholera, some even deadlier than the first, making it one of the most devastating public health crises in the city’s history. This epidemic underlined the dire need for a proper sewage and clean water system.
                In response to these urgent public health concerns, New York, along with cities around the world, began to develop more sophisticated infrastructure to provide clean drinking water and safely manage sewage. One of the crowning achievements of this movement was the completion of the first Croton Aqueduct in 1842, which brought fresh water to the city from Westchester County through a gravity-powered system. This monumental feat of engineering was celebrated with great fanfare, including a parade down Broadway, the ringing of church bells, and even cannon fire. Gravity-powered fountains, such as those in City Hall Park, shot water 50 feet into the air, a symbolic and literal representation of the city’s newfound access to clean water.
                Manhole covers became essential in accessing this underground water system, and many of these early covers are still in use today, a testament to the durability and ingenuity of 19th-century engineering. New York’s infrastructure includes relics from this period, such as the Croton Aqueduct manhole cover on Jersey Street in Soho, dating back to 1866. Though it might seem insignificant at first glance, this cover, likely covered in urban detritus like cigarette butts or scraps of trash, serves as a quiet reminder of the incredible feats of engineering that allowed New York to grow into the massive metropolis it is today.
                My own interest in manhole covers is a more recent development, sparked by the work of artists and urban historians who have brought these humble objects into the spotlight. Diana Stuart’s 2003 Designs Underfoot: The Art of Manhole Covers in New York City and Bob Jessen’s 2004 New York Lids: A Field Guide to New York City’s Coal Hole Covers are just two publications that explore the beauty and history of these often-overlooked pieces of urban infrastructure. I was particularly captivated after participating in a Jane’s Walk tour led by artist Michele Brody in May. Brody, whose own manhole cover design was installed on Wall Street in 2002, explained how her star-shaped relief referenced the Roman architecture of the now-destroyed Assay Office. Sadly, her cover was mistakenly removed in 2009, a loss that underscores the transient nature of even the most well-intentioned public art.
                Brody’s passion for manhole covers led her to create a self-guided tour of 14th Street as part of the 2009 Art in Odd Places festival, a tour that drew a large crowd eager to uncover the stories hidden beneath the city’s streets. As you begin to explore these covers, you discover a fascinating, unseen language. For example, the “ECS” covers, originally installed in the 19th century for the Empire City Subway system, once facilitated telegraph and phone cables and now mask Verizon’s internet communications. These layers of history, embedded in something as simple as a manhole cover, reveal the evolution of New York’s infrastructure and the ongoing relationship between the city and its underground systems.
                From the relics of the Croton Aqueduct to the contemporary artistic collaborations between utility companies and designers, New York’s manhole covers serve as both functional and symbolic links to the city’s past. They remind us of the innovation, crisis, and creativity that have shaped the metropolis, offering glimpses into a hidden world just beneath our feet. As we continue to uncover the stories behind New York City’s manhole covers, it becomes clear that these utilitarian objects serve as more than just access points to the city’s subterranean systems—they are markers of history, culture, and technological progress. Each cover tells a story of the city’s relentless growth, from its early struggles with public health crises to its ambitious engineering feats, like the Croton Aqueduct. These covers, often adorned with engravings, symbols, and abbreviations, offer a physical link to moments of urban development that have shaped the city as we know it today. One of the most fascinating aspects of these manhole covers is how they reflect the evolution of infrastructure, especially as technology changed over time. Early covers, marked with “ECS” for the Empire City Subway or “BRT” for Brooklyn Rapid Transit, hint at New York’s once-separate and now-integrated transit systems. These codes serve as a kind of hidden language beneath the city’s streets, each one a quiet witness to the technological advancements that allowed New York to become one of the world’s most interconnected cities. But beyond the practical, these manhole covers have also become canvases for artistic expression. Collaborations with contemporary artists like Michele Brody and Lawrence Weiner have transformed manhole covers into public art pieces, blurring the lines between function and creativity. Their work invites us to see the city not just as a network of streets, buildings, and utilities, but as a living, breathing organism where even the smallest details—like a metal disc underfoot—are part of a grand, interconnected narrative. Each cover is a reminder that beneath the surface of New York’s fast-paced, ever-evolving landscape, there lies a deeper, often overlooked story waiting to be discovered.</p>
