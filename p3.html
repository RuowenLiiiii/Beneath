                Have you ever really thought about roadlining? The markings that guide us as we drive—solid white lines, dashed yellow ones, arrows, and words—are such a fundamental part of our streets and highways that we rarely stop to consider how they got there in the first place. These seemingly simple lines are more than just paint on asphalt; they represent a complex and intricate craft, one that blends functionality with artistry. The people responsible for laying down these lines, words, and symbols are skilled craftspeople, often unnoticed in the daily rush of urban life. Roadlining is an art hidden in plain sight, essential for the safe and efficient movement of traffic.
                The 2016 short documentary Roadliners offers a rare glimpse into the world of roadliners, focusing on the skilled workers who paint the streets of Glasgow, Scotland. Among them is Thomas Lilley, who narrates parts of the documentary, reflecting on the significance of his craft. In the film, we see slow-motion footage of roadliners in neon workwear, dragging metal molds filled with hot, white thermoplastic material across the ground. As they work, they leave perfectly straight lines in their wake, lines that countless drivers will rely on for safety and guidance.
                "There’s a lot of pride involved in it," Lilley says. "Doing something that everybody’s going to use." For Lilley, roadlining is more than just a job. It’s a labor of love, a craft he’s been dedicated to for roughly 25 years, ever since he was 16 years old. His pride in the work is evident when he talks about his preference for doing the job freehand rather than using tape. "I’ve never used tape. Never ever. Always just done it freehand," he says with confidence. This precision is essential in roadlining—there’s no room for error. "We can’t go back and just bin it or start again. It’s gotta be done first time right or not at all."
                The meticulous nature of roadlining is something most of us take for granted. Each line, whether it’s a centerline dividing lanes of traffic or an edge line guiding drivers along the road’s boundary, must be applied with extreme care. A single mistake could jeopardize the safety of an entire stretch of road. Lilley’s dedication to getting it right the first time reflects the high stakes of this often-overlooked profession. "Something that every single person is basically going to use is a road," Lilley remarks, underscoring the importance of the work.
                Roadlining has a long history, one that dates back to the Roman Empire, where stones were used to guide travelers along routes like the famous Appian Way. As the centuries passed and the number of travelers increased, the need for more organized systems of navigation became apparent. But it wasn’t until the early 20th century, with the advent of the automobile, that road markings as we know them began to take shape. In 1917, Edward N. Hines, a road commissioner in Michigan, came up with the idea of painting a white line down the center of a road after seeing a milk truck’s leaking cargo create a makeshift guide. This simple yet revolutionary idea laid the groundwork for modern roadline marking systems.
                Today, roadliners like Lilley use advanced materials such as thermoplastic and preformed tape to create durable and visible road markings. Thermoplastic is applied as a hot liquid and hardens upon cooling, making it more resistant to wear and tear than traditional paint. Preformed tape, often used for temporary markings or small-scale projects, is easy to apply and remove. Additionally, glass beads—commonly referred to as cat’s eyes—are embedded into road markings to reflect light at night, enhancing visibility for drivers in low-light conditions.
                These materials are critical to ensuring that road markings remain effective and visible. But the roadliner’s role goes beyond just applying these materials. Road markings are carefully designed to serve specific functions, whether it’s guiding traffic, indicating parking restrictions, or marking reserved lanes for buses and bicycles. Longitudinal markings, like centerlines and lane lines, help separate traffic moving in the same or opposite directions, while transverse markings, like stop lines and crosswalks, ensure pedestrian safety and regulate vehicle movement at intersections.
                Roadlining plays a crucial role in maintaining safety on our streets. Clear, well-maintained road markings reduce the risk of accidents by providing drivers with the information they need to navigate safely. They indicate lane boundaries, signal upcoming turns, and warn of potential hazards, allowing drivers to make informed decisions on the road. In busy urban environments, where traffic can be chaotic and fast-paced, road markings help maintain order by directing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians alike.
               Beyond safety, road markings also contribute to the efficiency of traffic. Well-designed markings prevent congestion by encouraging the smooth flow of vehicles and reducing last-minute lane changes or abrupt stops that can cause delays. In this way, roadlining is not only an art but also a vital part of urban infrastructure that keeps our cities functioning smoothly.
                Maintaining these road markings is just as important as laying them down in the first place. Regular inspections are essential to ensure that markings are not faded or damaged. When problems are identified, timely repairs are necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the markings. Using durable materials like thermoplastic can help reduce the need for frequent maintenance, saving time and money in the long run. And as environmental concerns become increasingly important, some road markings are now being used to promote eco-friendly practices, such as marking rainwater collection areas or highlighting green spaces.
               While we often view sidewalks and road markings as purely functional, they also play a role in fostering a sense of community and even in shaping social interactions. In urban environments, sidewalks provide spaces for public art and serve as platforms for creative expression. Messages written in chalk or painted on the pavement can inspire, uplift, or provoke thought, turning the mundane act of walking down the street into a moment of reflection or connection.
               In the end, roadlining is a craft that blends tradition and innovation. From the ancient Roman roads to modern-day Glasgow, the people responsible for painting the lines on our streets have been quietly ensuring our safety and efficiency. And as Thomas Lilley’s reflections in Roadliners remind us, this work is far from simple. It requires skill, precision, and a deep sense of responsibility to get it right the first time. So, the next time you drive down a highway or cross a street, take a moment to appreciate the care and craftsmanship behind the lines that guide you.
